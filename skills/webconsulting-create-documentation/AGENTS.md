## Abstract

End-to-end workflow for building product documentation in Next.js applications.
Covers help page creation (collapsible sections, step-by-step instructions),
AI-generated placeholder illustrations, Remotion video composition with animated
scenes, TTS narration generation (ElevenLabs or macOS `say` fallback) in a
Jony Ive-inspired calm, deliberate style, Suno AI background music with volume
ducking, and GitHub README documentation with dark/light theme screenshots and
embedded video.

For the full skill with code examples and checklists, see
[SKILL.md](./SKILL.md).
