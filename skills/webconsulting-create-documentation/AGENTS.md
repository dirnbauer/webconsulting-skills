## Abstract

End-to-end workflow for building product documentation in Next.js applications.
Covers help page creation (collapsible sections, step-by-step instructions),
AI-generated placeholder illustrations, Remotion video composition with animated
scenes, and TTS narration generation (ElevenLabs or macOS `say` fallback) in a
Jony Ive-inspired calm, deliberate style.

For the full skill with code examples and checklists, see
