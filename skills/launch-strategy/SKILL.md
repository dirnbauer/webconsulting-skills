# Launch Strategy

Plan launches that build momentum, capture attention, and convert interest into users. The best companies don't just launch once—they launch again and again.

## The ORB Framework

Structure launch marketing across three channel types:

### Owned Channels
You own the channel (though not the audience).

- Email list
- Blog
- Podcast
- Branded community (Slack, Discord)
- Website/product

**Why they matter**: Get more effective over time, no algorithm changes, compound value.

### Rented Channels
Platforms that provide visibility but you don't control.

- Social media (Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Instagram)
- App stores and marketplaces
- YouTube, Reddit

**How to use**: Pick 1-2 platforms, use to drive traffic to owned channels.

### Borrowed Channels
Tap into someone else's audience.

- Guest content (blog posts, podcast interviews)
- Collaborations (webinars, co-marketing)
- Speaking engagements
- Influencer partnerships

**Example**: TRMNL sent a free e-ink display to YouTuber Snazzy Labs → 500K+ views → $500K+ in sales.

## Five-Phase Launch Approach

### Phase 1: Internal Launch
- Recruit early users one-on-one
- Collect feedback on usability gaps
- Prototype is functional enough to demo

**Goal**: Validate core functionality with friendly users.

### Phase 2: Alpha Launch
- Create landing page with early access signup
- Announce the product exists
- Invite users individually
- MVP working in production

**Goal**: First external validation and waitlist building.

### Phase 3: Beta Launch
- Work through early access list
- Start marketing with teasers
- Recruit friends, investors, influencers

**Consider adding**:
- Coming soon landing page
- "Beta" sticker in dashboard
- Early access toggle for experimental features

**Goal**: Build buzz and refine with broader feedback.

### Phase 4: Early Access Launch
- Leak product details: screenshots, GIFs, demos
- Gather quantitative usage data
- Run user research with engaged users
- Optionally run product/market fit survey

**Expansion options**:
- Throttle invites (5-10% at a time)
- Invite all at once under "early access" framing

**Goal**: Validate at scale and prepare for full launch.

### Phase 5: Full Launch
- Open self-serve signups
- Start charging (if not already)
- Announce general availability

**Launch touchpoints**:
- Customer emails
- In-app popups and product tours
- Website banner
- Blog post announcement
- Social posts
- Product Hunt, BetaList, Hacker News

**Goal**: Maximum visibility and conversion.

## Product Hunt Launch Strategy

### Pros
- Exposure to tech-savvy early adopters
- Credibility bump (especially if Product of the Day)
- Potential PR coverage and backlinks

### Cons
- Very competitive to rank well
- Short-lived traffic spikes
- Requires significant preparation

### How to Launch Successfully

**Before launch day**:
1. Build relationships with influential supporters
2. Optimize listing: compelling tagline, polished visuals, short demo video
3. Study successful launches
4. Engage in relevant communities
5. Prepare team for all-day engagement

**On launch day**:
1. Treat it as an all-day event
2. Respond to every comment
3. Encourage existing audience to engage
4. Direct traffic back to site for signups

**After launch**:
1. Follow up with everyone who engaged
2. Convert PH traffic into email signups
3. Continue momentum with post-launch content

---

## Post-Launch Product Marketing

### Immediate Actions

1. **Onboarding email sequence**: Introduce key features
2. **Roundup email**: Include announcement for those who missed it
3. **Comparison pages**: Publish why you're the obvious choice
4. **Update web pages**: Add sections about new feature
5. **Interactive demo**: No-code demo for visitors to explore

### Ongoing Launches

Use this matrix to decide marketing effort:

| Update Type | Marketing Level |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Major (new features, overhauls) | Full campaign, all channels |
| Medium (integrations, UI) | Targeted: email segments, in-app |
| Minor (bug fixes, tweaks) | Changelog only |

**Space out releases** to maintain momentum. Even changelog updates signal active development.
