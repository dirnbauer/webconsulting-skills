# Marketing Psychology & Mental Models

> **Prerequisite:** Read the main `SKILL.md` for overview and quick reference.

You are an expert in applying psychological principles and mental models to marketing. Your goal is to help users understand why people buy, how to influence behavior ethically, and how to make better marketing decisions.

---

## Foundational Thinking Models

### First Principles
Break problems down to basic truths and build solutions from there. Ask "why" repeatedly to find root causes.

**Marketing application:** Don't assume you need content marketing because competitors do. Ask why you need it, what problem it solves.

### Jobs to Be Done
People don't buy products—they "hire" them to get a job done. Focus on the outcome, not features.

**Marketing application:** A drill buyer doesn't want a drill—they want a hole. Frame your product around the job it accomplishes.

### Inversion
Instead of "How do I succeed?", ask "What would guarantee failure?" Then avoid those things.

**Marketing application:** List everything that would make your campaign fail, then systematically prevent each.

### Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)
80% of results come from 20% of efforts. Identify and focus on the vital few.

**Marketing application:** Find the 20% of channels, customers, or content driving 80% of results.

### Theory of Constraints
Every system has one bottleneck. Find and fix that constraint before optimizing elsewhere.

**Marketing application:** If your funnel converts well but traffic is low, conversion optimization won't help. Fix traffic first.

### Second-Order Thinking
Consider not just immediate effects, but the effects of those effects.

**Marketing application:** A flash sale boosts revenue (first order) but may train customers to wait for discounts (second order).

## Understanding Buyers

### Fundamental Attribution Error
People attribute others' behavior to character, not circumstances.

**Marketing application:** When customers don't convert, examine your process before blaming them.

### Mere Exposure Effect
People prefer things they've seen before. Familiarity breeds liking.

**Marketing application:** Consistent brand presence builds preference over time.

### Availability Heuristic
People judge likelihood by how easily examples come to mind.

**Marketing application:** Case studies and testimonials make success feel more achievable.

### Confirmation Bias
People seek information confirming existing beliefs.

**Marketing application:** Understand what your audience already believes and align accordingly.

### Mimetic Desire
People want things because others want them. Desire is socially contagious.

**Marketing application:** Show that desirable people want your product. Waitlists and exclusivity trigger mimetic desire.

### Endowment Effect
People value things more once they own them.

**Marketing application:** Free trials and samples let customers "own" the product, making them reluctant to give it up.

### IKEA Effect
People value things more when they've put effort into creating them.

**Marketing application:** Let customers customize or configure. Their investment increases perceived value.

### Zero-Price Effect
Free isn't just a low price—it's psychologically different.

**Marketing application:** Free tiers, free trials, and free shipping have disproportionate appeal.

### Present Bias
People strongly prefer immediate rewards over future ones.

**Marketing application:** Emphasize immediate benefits ("Start saving time today") over future ones.

### Status-Quo Bias
People prefer the current state of affairs. Change requires effort.

**Marketing application:** Reduce friction to switch. Make the transition feel safe and easy.

### Default Effect
People tend to accept pre-selected options. Defaults are powerful.

**Marketing application:** Pre-select the plan you want customers to choose.

### Paradox of Choice
Too many options overwhelm. Fewer choices often lead to more decisions.

**Marketing application:** Three pricing tiers beat seven. Recommend a single "best for most" option.

### Goal-Gradient Effect
People accelerate effort as they approach a goal.

**Marketing application:** Show progress bars and "almost there" messaging.

### Peak-End Rule
People judge experiences by the peak moment and the end, not the average.

**Marketing application:** Design memorable peaks and strong endings.

### Zeigarnik Effect
Unfinished tasks occupy the mind more than completed ones.

**Marketing application:** "You're 80% done" creates pull to finish.

## Persuasion Principles

### Reciprocity
People feel obligated to return favors. Give first.

**Marketing application:** Free content, free tools create reciprocal obligation.

### Commitment & Consistency
Once people commit, they want to stay consistent.

**Marketing application:** Get small commitments first. People who've taken one step are more likely to take the next.

### Authority Bias
People defer to experts and authority figures.

**Marketing application:** Feature expert endorsements, certifications, "featured in" logos.

### Liking / Similarity
People say yes to those they like and those similar to themselves.

**Marketing application:** Use relatable spokespeople, founder stories, community language.

### Unity Principle
Shared identity drives influence. "One of us" is powerful.

**Marketing application:** Position your brand as part of the customer's tribe.

### Scarcity
Limited availability increases perceived value.

**Marketing application:** Limited-time offers, low-stock warnings, exclusive access. Only use when genuine.

### Foot-in-the-Door
Start with a small request, then escalate.

**Marketing application:** Free trial → paid plan → annual plan → enterprise.

### Door-in-the-Face
Start large, then retreat to what you actually want.

**Marketing application:** Show enterprise pricing first, then reveal the affordable starter plan.

### Loss Aversion
Losses feel twice as painful as equivalent gains.

**Marketing application:** Frame in terms of what they'll lose by not acting.

### Anchoring Effect
The first number heavily influences subsequent judgments.

**Marketing application:** Show the higher price first to anchor expectations.

### Decoy Effect
Adding an inferior third option makes one original option look better.

**Marketing application:** A "decoy" tier makes your preferred tier the obvious choice.

### Framing Effect
How something is presented changes perception.

**Marketing application:** "90% success rate" vs. "10% failure rate" feel different.

---

## Pricing Psychology

### Charm Pricing
Prices ending in 9 seem significantly lower. $99 feels much cheaper than $100.

**Marketing application:** Use .99 endings for value-focused products.

### Rounded-Price Effect
Round numbers feel premium. $100 signals quality; $99 signals value.

**Marketing application:** Use round prices for premium products, charm prices for value.

### Rule of 100
Under $100: percentage discounts seem larger ("20% off").
Over $100: absolute discounts seem larger ("$50 off").

**Marketing application:** $80 product: "20% off" beats "$16 off."

### Mental Accounting
Framing the same price differently changes perception.

**Marketing application:** "$1/day" feels cheaper than "$30/month."

## Behavior Design

### BJ Fogg Behavior Model
Behavior = Motivation × Ability × Prompt. All three must be present.

**Marketing application:** High motivation but hard to do = won't happen. Design for all three.

### EAST Framework
Make desired behaviors: Easy, Attractive, Social, Timely.

**Marketing application:** Reduce friction, make it appealing, show others doing it, ask at the right moment.

### Activation Energy
The initial energy required to start something.

**Marketing application:** Pre-fill forms, offer templates, show quick wins. Make the first step trivially easy.

### Hick's Law
Decision time increases with number of choices.

**Marketing application:** Simplify choices. One clear CTA beats three.

## Questions to Ask

1. What specific behavior are you trying to influence?
2. What does your customer believe before encountering your marketing?
