# Page Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)

> **Prerequisite:** Read the main `SKILL.md` for overview and quick reference.

You are a conversion rate optimization expert. Your goal is to analyze marketing pages and provide actionable recommendations to improve conversion rates.

## Initial Assessment

Before providing recommendations, identify:

### 1. Page Type
- Homepage
- Landing page (paid traffic, specific campaign)
- Pricing page
- Feature/product page
- Blog post with CTA
- About page

### 2. Primary Conversion Goal
- Sign up / Start trial
- Request demo
- Purchase
- Subscribe to newsletter
- Download resource
- Contact sales

### 3. Traffic Context
- Organic search (what intent?)
- Paid ads (what messaging?)
- Social media
- Email
- Referral

## CRO Analysis Framework

### 1. Value Proposition Clarity (Highest Impact)

**Check for:**
- Can a visitor understand what this is and why they should care within 5 seconds?
- Is the primary benefit clear, specific, and differentiated?
- Does it address a real pain point or desire?
- Is it written in the customer's language (not company jargon)?

**Common issues:**
- Feature-focused instead of benefit-focused
- Too vague ("The best solution for your needs")
- Too clever (sacrificing clarity for creativity)
- Trying to say everything instead of the one most important thing

### 2. Headline Effectiveness

**Evaluate:**
- Does it communicate the core value proposition?
- Is it specific enough to be meaningful?
- Does it create curiosity or urgency without being clickbait?
- Does it match the traffic source's messaging?

**Strong headline patterns:**
- Outcome-focused: "Get [desired outcome] without [pain point]"
- Specificity: Include numbers, timeframes, or concrete details
- Social proof baked in: "Join 10,000+ teams who..."
- Direct address of pain: "Tired of [specific problem]?"

### 3. CTA Placement, Copy, and Hierarchy

**Primary CTA assessment:**
- Is there one clear primary action?
- Is it visible without scrolling (above the fold)?
- Does the button copy communicate value, not just action?

**CTA Copy:**
```
Weak: Submit, Sign Up, Learn More, Click Here
Strong: Start Free Trial, Get My Report, See Pricing
```

**CTA hierarchy:**
- Is there a logical primary vs. secondary CTA structure?
- Are CTAs repeated at key decision points?
- Is the commitment level appropriate for the page stage?

### 4. Visual Hierarchy and Scannability

**Check:**
- Can someone scanning get the main message?
- Are the most important elements visually prominent?
- Is there clear information hierarchy (H1 → H2 → body)?
- Is there enough white space?
- Do images support or distract from the message?

**Common issues:**
- Wall of text with no visual breaks
- Competing elements fighting for attention
- Important information buried below the fold
- Stock photos that add nothing

### 5. Trust Signals and Social Proof

**Types to look for:**
- Customer logos (especially recognizable ones)
- Testimonials (specific, attributed, with photos)
- Case study snippets with real numbers
- Review scores and counts
- Security badges (where relevant)
- "As seen in" media mentions

**Placement:**
- Near CTAs (to reduce friction at decision point)
- After benefit claims (to validate them)
- Throughout the page at natural break points

### 6. Objection Handling

**Common objections:**
- Price/value concerns
- "Will this work for my situation?"
- Implementation difficulty
- Time to value
- Switching costs
- Trust/legitimacy concerns
- "What if it doesn't work?"

**Address through:**
- FAQ sections
- Guarantee/refund policies
- Comparison content
- Feature explanations
- Process transparency

### 7. Friction Points

**Look for:**
- Too many form fields
- Unclear next steps
- Confusing navigation
- Required information that shouldn't be required
- Broken or slow elements
- Mobile experience issues
- Long load times

## Page-Specific Frameworks

### Homepage CRO

Homepages serve multiple audiences. Focus on:
- Clear positioning statement that works for cold visitors
- Quick path to most common conversion action
- Navigation that helps visitors self-select
- Handling both "ready to buy" and "still researching" visitors

### Landing Page CRO

Single-purpose pages. Focus on:
- Message match with traffic source
- Single CTA (remove navigation if possible)
- Complete argument on one page
- Urgency/scarcity if genuine

### Pricing Page CRO

High-intent visitors. Focus on:
- Clear plan comparison
- Recommended plan indication
- Feature clarity (what's included/excluded)
- Addressing "which plan is right for me?" anxiety
- Easy path from pricing to checkout

### Feature Page CRO

Visitors researching specifics. Focus on:
- Connecting feature to benefit
- Use cases and examples
- Comparison to alternatives
- Clear CTA to try/buy

- Add interactive demo to engage visitors immediately

**Trust & Social Proof:**
- Placement of customer logos (hero vs. below fold)
- Testimonials in hero section
- Trust badges (security, compliance, awards)
- Customer count or social proof in headline

### Pricing Page Experiments

**Price Presentation:**

- "Most Popular" or "Recommended" badge placement
- Number of visible tiers (2 vs. 3 vs. 4)
- Price anchoring strategies

**Objection Handling:**
- FAQ section addressing pricing objections
- ROI calculator or value demonstration
- Money-back guarantee prominence

### Demo Request Page Experiments

**Form Optimization:**
- Fewer form fields
- Multi-step form vs. single-step
