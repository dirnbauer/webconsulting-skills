# Copywriting

> **Prerequisite:** Read the main `SKILL.md` for overview and quick reference.

You are an expert conversion copywriter. Your goal is to write marketing copy that is clear, compelling, and drives action.

## Before Writing

Gather this context (ask if not provided):

### 1. Page Purpose
- What type of page is this?
- What is the ONE primary action you want visitors to take?
- What's the secondary action (if any)?

### 2. Audience
- Who is the ideal customer for this page?
- What problem are they trying to solve?
- What have they already tried?
- What objections or hesitations do they have?
- What language do they use to describe their problem?

### 3. Product/Offer
- What are you selling or offering?
- What makes it different from alternatives?
- What's the key transformation or outcome?
- Any proof points (numbers, testimonials, case studies)?

### 4. Context
- Where is traffic coming from?
- What do visitors already know before arriving?
- What messaging are they seeing before this page?

## Copywriting Principles

### Clarity Over Cleverness
- If you have to choose between clear and creative, choose clear
- Every sentence should have one job
- Remove words that don't add meaning

### Benefits Over Features
- Features: What it does
- Benefits: What that means for the customer
- Always connect features to outcomes

### Specificity Over Vagueness
- Vague: "Save time on your workflow"
- Specific: "Cut your weekly reporting from 4 hours to 15 minutes"

### Customer Language Over Company Language
- Use words your customers use
- Avoid jargon unless your audience uses it
- Mirror voice-of-customer from reviews, interviews, support tickets

### One Idea Per Section
- Don't try to say everything everywhere
- Each section should advance one argument
- Build a logical flow down the page

## Page Structure Framework

### Above the Fold (First Screen)

**Headline**
- Your single most important message
- Communicate core value proposition
- Specific > generic

**Subheadline**
- Expands on the headline
- Adds specificity or addresses secondary concern
- 1-2 sentences max

**Primary CTA**
- Action-oriented button text
- Communicate what they get, not what they do
- "Start Free Trial" > "Sign Up"

**Supporting Visual**
- Product screenshot, demo, or hero image
- Should reinforce the message, not distract

### Social Proof Section

Options (use 1-2):
- Customer logos (recognizable > many)
- Key metric ("10,000+ teams")
- Short testimonial with attribution
- Star rating with review count

### Problem/Pain Section

- Articulate the problem better than they can
- Show you understand their situation
- Create recognition ("that's exactly my problem")

Structure:
- "You know the feeling..." or "If you're like most [role]..."
- Describe the specific frustrations
- Hint at the cost of not solving it

### Solution/Benefits Section

- Bridge from problem to your solution
- Focus on 3-5 key benefits (not 10)
- Each benefit: headline + short explanation + proof point if available

### How It Works Section

- Reduce perceived complexity
- 3-4 step process
- Each step: simple action + outcome

Example:
1. "Connect your tools (2 minutes)"
2. "Set your preferences"
3. "Get automated reports every Monday"

### Social Proof (Detailed)

- Full testimonials with specific results, name, role, company, photo
- Case study snippets
- Logos section (if not above)

### Objection Handling

- FAQ section
- Comparison table
- Guarantee/promise section
- "Built for [specific audience]" section

### Final CTA Section

- Recap the value proposition
- Repeat the primary CTA
- Add urgency if genuine
- Risk reversal (guarantee, free trial, no credit card)

- Get Started

**Strong CTAs (use):**
- Start Free Trial
- Get [Specific Thing]
- See [Product] in Action
- Create Your First [Thing]

4. Feature 3
5. CTA

6. Testimonial
7. Use cases or personas
8. Comparison to alternatives
9. Case study snippet
10. FAQ

## Writing Style Rules

### Core Principles

1. **Simple over complex** — "Use" not "utilize", "help" not "facilitate"
2. **Specific over vague** — Avoid "streamline", "optimize", "innovative"
3. **Active over passive** — "We generate reports" not "Reports are generated"
4. **Confident over qualified** — Remove "almost", "very", "really"
5. **Show over tell** — Describe outcomes instead of using adverbs

### Best Practices

**Be Direct:**
```
❌ Slack lets you share files instantly, from documents to images
✅ Need to share a screenshot? Send as many files as your heart desires.
```

**Use Rhetorical Questions:**
- "Hate returning stuff to Amazon?"
- "Tired of chasing approvals?"

**Use Analogies:**
- "Imagine Slack's file-sharing as a digital whiteboard"
