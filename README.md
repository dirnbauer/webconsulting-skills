# webconsulting Claude Marketplace

AI-augmented development environment for enterprise TYPO3 projects. This repository provides **Agent Skills** that transform Claude into a specialized TYPO3 Solutions Architect.

> **Attribution:** The majority of skills in this repository are derived from the excellent work by
> **[Netresearch DTT GmbH](https://github.com/netresearch)**. We recommend using their original
> repositories for the latest updates. A few additional skills are specific to webconsulting.at.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:dirnbauer/claude-cursor-typo3-skills.git
cd claude-cursor-typo3-skills

# Install skills
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh

# Restart Cursor IDE
```

### Alternative: Composer Agent Skill Plugin

For automatic skill loading in PHP projects, use Netresearch's Composer plugin:

```bash
composer require --dev netresearch/composer-agent-skill-plugin
```

This plugin automatically discovers and loads agent skills from your Composer dependencies.
See: https://github.com/netresearch/composer-agent-skill-plugin

### Alternative: Composer from GitHub (VCS)

Install this skills package directly from GitHub without Packagist.

**1. Add the repository to your project's `composer.json`:**

```json
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "https://github.com/dirnbauer/claude-cursor-typo3-skills"
        }
    ]
}
```

**2. Require the package:**

```bash
composer require --dev webconsulting/claude-typo3-skills:dev-main
```

The Composer plugin will automatically run `install.sh` after installation to deploy skills to `~/.claude/skills` and generate Cursor rules.

## How to Use Agent Skills

### Skills for Dummies

**What are Agent Skills?** They're Markdown files containing expert knowledge that Claude in Cursor reads to become a specialist. After running `./install.sh`, each skill becomes a `.mdc` rule file in `.cursor/rules/` that Cursor automatically loads.

**How do they work?** When you chat with Claude in Cursor, it reads the rules from `.cursor/rules/`. Each skill has **trigger keywords** - when you mention these words, Claude applies that skill's knowledge to help you.

**Where do skills live?**
- Source files: `skills/*/SKILL.md` (this repo)
- Cursor rules: `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` (generated by install.sh)

### Discovery Commands

```bash
# List all installed Cursor rules (skills)
ls .cursor/rules/

# View a specific skill's content
cat .cursor/rules/typo3-ddev.mdc

# Search for a keyword across all skills
grep -r "DataHandler" .cursor/rules/

# Re-install after pulling updates
./install.sh
```

### Pro Tips

1. **Use trigger keywords naturally** - Just mention "ddev" or "datahandler" in your prompt
2. **Be explicit for complex tasks** - Start with "Using the security-audit skill..."
3. **Combine skills** - "Using typo3-rector and typo3-testing, upgrade my extension and add tests"
4. **Check the skill source** - Read `skills/*/SKILL.md` for full documentation
