# webconsulting Agent Skills

> **TYPO3 skills:** Guidance here targets **TYPO3 v14.x** only. Those skills **will change** as v14 evolves — **through and after** the v14 LTS release. Always verify third-party extensions on Packagist (`require.typo3/cms-core`) for your project.

A curated collection of **72 Agent Skills** from **webconsulting** for AI-augmented software development. Some skills are built in-house, others are carefully imported, adapted, and maintained from strong open-source foundations. Together they give your AI coding assistant a practical, production-focused toolkit for TYPO3, frontend work, security, legal compliance, video, documentation, and enterprise engineering.

> **Core installer:** Cursor, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenAI Codex, and Windsurf. Other tools such as GitHub Copilot, Cline, Aider, and Kiro can be added with native instruction files or a manual skills-directory link.

> **Install script status:** The installer has been tested with Cursor, Claude Desktop, and OpenAI Codex.

### A Note from the Maintainer

This repository is meant to be useful on real projects: a technically solid collection of
agent skills from webconsulting that helps teams move faster without lowering engineering quality.
The goal is straightforward: one place for reusable skill knowledge that can be installed,
synced, and used across multiple AI coding clients.

Many of the TYPO3 and PHP skills in this collection build on the excellent open-source work by
**[Netresearch DTT GmbH](https://www.netresearch.de/)**. Their repositories have been an important
foundation for this collection, and their contribution to practical TYPO3 and PHP engineering
deserves clear credit. Thank you, Netresearch, and thank you as well to the engineers,
maintainers, and contributors behind that work. This collection is better because of the
care, clarity, and generosity you brought to the TYPO3 ecosystem.

## 🚀 Universal Agent Skills (5 Core Clients + Optional Tools)

Skills are installed as **symlinks** from the central `skills/` directory to the five core clients' discovery paths. One source of truth, many consumers.
To add a skill, create `skills/<slug>/SKILL.md` once. Do not add client-specific symlinks or duplicate per-client copies; `./install.sh` and `./update.sh` fan the canonical skill directory out automatically.

### Core Scripted Clients

| Client | Installation | Discovery |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Cursor** | Symlinks to `~/.cursor/skills/` + `.cursor/skills/` + `.mdc` rules | Auto-discovery, `/skill-name` invocation |
| **Claude Code** | Symlinks to `~/.claude/skills/` | Auto-loaded from user skills |
| **Gemini CLI** | Symlinks to `~/.gemini/skills/` + `.gemini/skills/` + `gemini-extension.json` | Native extension manifest |
| **OpenAI Codex** | Symlinks to `~/.codex/skills/` + `.codex/skills/` | User and project-level discovery |
| **Windsurf** | Symlinks to `~/.codeium/windsurf/skills/` + `.windsurf/skills/` | User and project-level discovery |

### Native and Optional Clients

| Client Type | Setup | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| **GitHub Copilot, Cline, Aider** | Read `AGENTS.md` or their native instruction file | No separate skill-directory install needed |
| **Kiro and other skill-directory clients** | Add a manual symlink target once | Keep `skills/` as the only source of truth |

### Directory Structure After Install

```
~/.cursor/skills/          ← Cursor (user-level)
~/.claude/skills/          ← Claude Code (user-level)
~/.gemini/skills/          ← Gemini CLI (user-level)
~/.codex/skills/           ← OpenAI Codex (user-level)
~/.codeium/windsurf/skills/← Windsurf (user-level)

.cursor/
  ├── skills/              ← Cursor (project-level)
  └── rules/               ← Legacy .mdc files (backwards compat)
.gemini/skills/            ← Gemini CLI (project-level)
.codex/skills/             ← OpenAI Codex (project-level)
.windsurf/skills/          ← Windsurf (project-level)

gemini-extension.json      ← Gemini CLI extension manifest
AGENTS.md                  ← Read natively by Copilot, Codex, Windsurf, Cline, Aider
CLAUDE.md                  ← Claude Code primary instructions (→ AGENTS.md)
GEMINI.md                  ← Gemini CLI primary instructions (→ AGENTS.md)
.github/copilot-instructions.md  ← GitHub Copilot instructions (→ AGENTS.md)
.windsurfrules             ← Windsurf project rules (→ AGENTS.md)
```

### Adding a Skill

1. Create `skills/<slug>/SKILL.md`.
2. Add `references/`, `examples/`, `scripts/`, or `assets/` only if the skill needs them.
3. If the skill is upstream-managed, add one entry to `.sync-config.json`.
4. Run `./install.sh`.

Do not create manual per-client symlinks, duplicate `SKILL.md` files, or client-specific install rules for an individual skill. The installer loops over `skills/*` and populates every core client location automatically.

### Adding Other Tools

If a client has its own skills directory and is not one of the five core scripted clients, wire it once with a simple loop:

```bash
TARGET_DIR="$HOME/.kiro/skills" # replace with the client's skill path
mkdir -p "$TARGET_DIR"

for skill_dir in "$PWD"/skills/*; do
  [ -f "$skill_dir/SKILL.md" ] || continue
  ln -sfn "$skill_dir" "$TARGET_DIR/$(basename "$skill_dir")"
done
```

If the client reads an instruction file instead of a skills directory, point it at `AGENTS.md` or the client's native equivalent. Keep `skills/` as the canonical source and avoid copying `SKILL.md` files into per-tool folders.

### Using Skills

**In Cursor:**
1. **Auto-applied**: Cursor decides when skills are relevant
2. **Manual invoke**: Type `/typo3-content-blocks` in Agent chat
3. **View all**: Go to `Cursor Settings → Rules` to see discovered skills

**In Claude Code:**
1. Skills are automatically loaded from `~/.claude/skills/`
2. Reference skills in your prompts or let Claude auto-detect

**In Gemini CLI:**
1. Skills are discovered via `gemini-extension.json` manifest
2. Trigger-based activation matches your prompt to relevant skills

**In native-instruction clients:**
1. Use `AGENTS.md` or the client's native instruction file
2. No separate skill-directory install is required

**In optional manual clients:**
1. Point the client at its own skills directory
2. Use the symlink loop above to mirror `skills/*` into that directory

> **Note:** Legacy `.mdc` rules are still generated in `.cursor/rules/` for backwards compatibility.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Standalone Installation (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:dirnbauer/webconsulting-skills.git
cd webconsulting-skills

# Install skills
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh

# Restart Cursor IDE or Claude Code
```

### Option 2: Clone as Project Subdirectory

```bash
# From your project root
git clone git@github.com:dirnbauer/webconsulting-skills.git webconsulting-skills

# Install skills (auto-detects parent project)
cd webconsulting-skills
./install.sh

# Skills are installed to the supported core AI client directories
```

> The installer auto-detects if it's running from a vendor directory, project subdirectory, or standalone clone, and adjusts paths accordingly.

### Alternative: Composer from GitHub (VCS)

Install this skills package directly from GitHub without Packagist.

**1. Add the repository to your project's `composer.json`:**

```json
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "https://github.com/dirnbauer/webconsulting-skills"
        }
    ]
}
```

**2. Require the package:**

```bash
composer require --dev webconsulting/webconsulting-skills:dev-main
```

The Composer plugin will automatically run `install.sh` after installation to deploy skills to the supported core AI client directories.

## How to Use Agent Skills

### Skills for Dummies

**What are Agent Skills?** They're Markdown files (`SKILL.md`) containing expert knowledge that your AI coding assistant reads to become a specialist. After running `./install.sh`, skills are symlinked to the supported core AI client directories and automatically discovered.

**How do they work?** 
- **Auto-applied**: Cursor's Agent decides when a skill is relevant based on your query
- **Manual invoke**: Type `/skill-name` in chat (e.g., `/remotion-best-practices`, `/security-audit`)
- **Trigger keywords**: Mentioning keywords like "video", "animation", "security audit", or "content-blocks" activates relevant skills

**Where do skills live?**
- Source files: `skills/*/SKILL.md` (this repo)
- User-level: `~/.cursor/skills/`, `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.gemini/skills/`, `~/.codex/skills/`, `~/.codeium/windsurf/skills/`
- Project-level: `.cursor/skills/`, `.gemini/skills/`, `.codex/skills/`, `.windsurf/skills/`
- Legacy rules: `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` (backwards compatibility)
- Cross-client: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.windsurfrules`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `gemini-extension.json`
- Optional/manual clients: any tool-specific skills directory you wire to `skills/`
- Adding a skill only touches `skills/` and, for upstream-managed skills, `.sync-config.json`

#### ⚛️ React & Next.js Performance (Vercel Best Practices)

The `react-best-practices` skill contains **69 rules across 8 priority categories** from Vercel Engineering. It automatically detects performance anti-patterns and suggests fixes prioritized by impact.

**Why it's cool:** Instead of guessing what to optimize, you get Vercel's battle-tested rules applied automatically. The skill catches issues like request waterfalls, bundle bloat, and re-render storms that kill Core Web Vitals.

**Critical: Eliminate Waterfalls (Priority 1)**

```
I have this data fetching code that feels slow:

const user = await fetchUser(id);
const posts = await fetchPosts(userId);
const comments = await fetchComments(postId);

Why is it slow and how do I fix it?
```

```
Add Suspense boundaries to my Next.js page so the header shows immediately while data loads.
```

```
My API route awaits a database call early but only uses it in one branch. How do I defer the await?
```

**Critical: Bundle Size (Priority 2)**

```
My Next.js bundle is 2MB. Analyze my imports and find barrel file imports that pull in entire libraries.
```

```
I'm importing a heavy charting library. Show me how to use next/dynamic with a loading skeleton.
```

```
Move my analytics initialization to after hydration so it doesn't block the main bundle.
```

```
I have a feature flag that controls a heavy component. Only load the component when the flag is true.
```

**High: Server-Side Performance (Priority 3)**

```
I'm calling getUser() in multiple server components. Show me how to use React.cache() to deduplicate.
```

```
Restructure this server component to start fetches in the parent and await in children (parallel fetching).
```

```
I need to log analytics after responding. Use next/after() to make it non-blocking.
```

```
My server component passes a huge object to a client component. How do I minimize serialization?
```

**Medium-High: Client-Side Data Fetching (Priority 4)**

```
Convert my useEffect + useState data fetching to SWR for automatic deduplication and caching.
```

```
I'm adding scroll event listeners in multiple components. Show me how to deduplicate them.
```

```
Make my scroll listeners passive to improve scrolling performance.
```

**Medium: Re-render Optimization (Priority 5)**

```
This component re-renders every time state changes, but it only uses state in a callback. Fix it.
```

```
Extract my expensive list rendering into a memoized component.
```

```
My callback changes on every render because it references count. Use functional setState.
```

```
I'm computing derived state in useEffect. Show me how to derive it during render instead.
```

```
My search input lags because filtering is slow. Use startTransition for the non-urgent filter update.
```

```
I'm storing mouse position in state but I only use it in event handlers. Use a ref instead.
```

**Medium: Rendering Performance (Priority 6)**

```
I have a long list with 1000 items. Add content-visibility: auto for performance.
```

```
This static JSX is defined inside the component. Hoist it outside to avoid recreating.
```

```
I'm animating an SVG directly. Wrap it in a div and animate the wrapper instead.
```

```
I get hydration mismatch warnings for user-specific data. How do I handle client-only values?
```

**Low-Medium: JavaScript Performance (Priority 7)**

```
I'm setting multiple CSS properties in a loop. Batch them using cssText or a class.
```

```
I'm doing array.includes() in a loop. Build a Set for O(1) lookups.
```

```
I'm accessing object.nested.value repeatedly in a loop. Cache it in a variable.
```

```
I have filter().map().filter(). Combine into a single loop.
```

```
This function sorts an array just to find the max. Use a loop instead.
```

**Advanced Patterns (Priority 8)**

```
My event handler function changes every render. Store it in a ref for stable reference.
```

```
I need to initialize an SDK once per app load, not per render. Show me the init-once pattern.
```

## Configuration

### MCP Servers

Edit `.cursor/mcp.json` to add your MCP server configurations:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ddev": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@codingsasi/ddev-mcp"]
    },
    "hetzner": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-hetzner"],
      "env": {
        "HCLOUD_TOKEN": "${HCLOUD_TOKEN}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Updating Skills

**Quick Update (recommended):**

```bash
# Update everything in one command
./update.sh --pull

# Or step by step:
git pull origin main
./update.sh
```

**Using Composer:**

```bash
# Update skills via composer
composer skills:update

# Sync external skills only (no reinstall)
composer skills:sync

# List all available skills
composer skills:list

# Full reinstall
composer skills:install
```

**Update Script Options:**

```bash
./update.sh              # Sync external skills and reinstall
./update.sh --pull       # Pull git changes first, then update
./update.sh --sync-only  # Only sync external skills, don't reinstall
./update.sh --force      # Stash local changes if needed
./update.sh --dry-run    # Show what would be done without making changes
./update.sh --help       # Show all options
```

### GitHub Push -> skills.sh Publish (Checklist)

Use this simple flow to keep publication deterministic:

```bash
# 1) Push skill changes
git push origin main

# 2) Refresh imported skills if needed
./update.sh --sync-only

# 3) Regenerate local mirrors
./install.sh

# 4) Commit generated files and push
git add -A && git commit -m "chore: refresh generated skill mirrors" && git push
```

Then run the GitHub workflow `skills-sh-publish-check.yml` (manual dispatch) and verify your skill on skills.sh by searching for repository + skill name.

**Syncing External Skills:**

The `.sync-config.json` file defines external skill sources that are automatically synchronized:

```json
{
  "skills": [
    {
      "name": "react-best-practices",
      "source": "https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-skills.git",
      "branch": "main",
      "path": "skills/react-best-practices",
      "enabled": true
    }
  ]
}
```

To enable/disable external skill syncing, edit `.sync-config.json` and set `enabled: true/false`.

The curated `skills/marketing-skills/` wrapper remains repo-owned and keeps its
upstream thank-you/reference text, but it is not backed by a full mirrored copy
of Corey Haines' repository inside `external/`.

**GitHub Actions Auto-Sync:**

The `sync-skills.yml` workflow runs weekly (Mondays 06:00 UTC) and can be triggered manually. It syncs enabled skills from upstream repos and opens a PR on the `chore/sync-skills` branch.

The repository also enforces upstream attribution guardrails in CI via
`scripts/check_attribution_guardrails.py` and `.github/workflows/attribution-guardrails.yml`.
That check fails if an upstream-derived skill loses its `Credits & Attribution` block or thank-you
message, or if the README stops naming upstream sources and
their original repositories explicitly.

**Required repo setting:** Go to **Settings > Actions > General > Workflow permissions** and enable **"Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"** for the workflow to create PRs automatically.

> **Note:** The installer removes and recreates symlinks on each run, so running `./install.sh` or `./update.sh` after pulling always ensures your skills are up to date.

## Contributing

1. Create a skill in `skills/your-skill-name/SKILL.md`
2. Follow the SKILL.md format (see existing skills)
3. If the skill is adapted from an upstream source, add a full `Credits & Attribution`
   block in `SKILL.md` with the upstream owner, original repository, thank-you message,
   and `Adapted by webconsulting.at for this skill collection`
4. Keep the Netresearch-specific thank-you wording for Netresearch-derived skills
5. Run `python3 scripts/check_attribution_guardrails.py` and `./install.sh` to test
6. Submit a pull request

Most upstream-derived skills are auto-discovered from their `SKILL.md` attribution, so you do not
need to register every new upstream skill in `scripts/audit_skills.py`. Only add a manual override
there if the repo should display a different origin owner than the upstream repository itself.
