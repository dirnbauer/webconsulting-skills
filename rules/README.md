# TYPO3 Agent Rules

Atomic, always-on coding guardrails for **TYPO3 v14** development. Rules are the
TYPO3 adaptation of the agent "rules" concept: short, file-targeted, severity-graded
constraints that an AI coding agent loads automatically and enforces while it writes
or reviews code.

## Rules vs. skills

| | Rule | Skill |
|---|---|---|
| Shape | Atomic, ≤ ~45 lines | Procedural, multi-step |
| Activation | Always-on (matched by `appliesTo` globs) | On-demand (matched by task intent) |
| Purpose | "Never do X / always do Y" guardrail | "Here is how to do X" guide |
| Output | A pass/fail constraint | A walkthrough |

A rule answers *"is this change allowed?"*. A skill answers *"how do I build this?"*.

## File format

One rule per Markdown file with YAML frontmatter, then a short normative body:

```yaml
---
id: <category>-<kebab-slug>          # unique, matches filename
title: "<imperative one-liner>"
category: <category>                  # = parent directory name
severity: error | warning | info
appliesTo: ["**/Classes/**/*.php"]    # glob(s) of files the rule targets
typo3: ">=14.0"
php: ">=8.2"
trigger: "Use when <situation>."
---
```

The body states the rule in 1–2 sentences, gives an explicit **Do** / **Don't**,
shows one minimal *verified* code example, and ends with a `> Why:` line citing the
TYPO3 changelog issue where the fact was confirmed.

## Severity

- **error** — *blocking*. A change that violates this rule is wrong and must not ship.
  Agents must refuse to introduce it and should fix existing occurrences they touch.
- **warning** — *advisory*. Strongly discouraged; the agent flags it and proposes the
  correct approach, but it does not hard-block unrelated work.
- **info** — *note*. Best-practice guidance and conventions worth following.

## `appliesTo` globs

Each rule declares the file patterns it governs (relative to an extension root), e.g.
`**/Classes/**/*.php`, `**/Configuration/TCA/**/*.php`, `**/Resources/Private/**/*.html`.
A rule only applies to a change if at least one changed file matches one of its globs.

## How an agent consumes these rules

1. Determine the set of files being created or modified.
2. Load every rule whose `appliesTo` glob matches any changed file.
3. Apply the rule's normative statement while generating or reviewing code.
4. Treat `error` rules as **blocking** (do not produce code that violates them);
   surface `warning`/`info` rules as advice.
5. When the `typo3` / `php` constraints don't match the target project, skip the rule.

All rules here are written and verified against the installed **TYPO3 v14.3.3** core.
Org naming convention: example extension keys/prefixes use `webcon_*`, never `wc_*`.
