# Security Incident Reporting

Use this skill when:
- Documenting a security incident (DDoS, breach, hack)
- Creating post-mortem reports
- Analyzing attack patterns and correlating CVEs
- Communicating with stakeholders about incidents
- Reporting vulnerabilities to the TYPO3 Security Team

## Key Resources

- [SKILL.md](mdc:skills/security-incident-reporting/SKILL.md) - General incident reporting framework
- [SKILL-TYPO3.md](mdc:skills/security-incident-reporting/SKILL-TYPO3.md) - TYPO3-specific forensics and Security Team communication

## Quick Reference

### Report Structure (NIST/SANS)

1. **Module A**: Metadata & Executive Summary
2. **Module B**: Timeline (chronological events)
3. **Module C**: Technical Analysis & IoCs

### Severity Ratings

| System | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| NCISS (1-6) | General cyber incidents |
| DRS (1-7) | DDoS attacks |
| CVSS v3.1 | Vulnerability scoring |

### TYPO3 Security Team

- **Email**: security@typo3.org
- **PGP Key ID**: C05FBE60
- **Policy**: Responsible disclosure, embargo until advisory

### Blameless Post-Mortem Principles

- Focus on systems, not individuals
- "Why did the process allow X?" not "Who did X?"
- Goal: improvement, not blame
