## Quick Reference: CRO Framework

### Page Optimization Priority

1. **Value Proposition Clarity** — Can visitors understand what this is in 5 seconds?
2. **Headline Effectiveness** — Does it communicate core value?
3. **CTA Placement & Copy** — Is there one clear action with value-focused button text?
4. **Visual Hierarchy** — Can someone scanning get the main message?
5. **Trust Signals** — Social proof near CTAs and after benefit claims
6. **Objection Handling** — FAQ, guarantees, comparisons
7. **Friction Removal** — Form fields, load times, mobile experience

### Strong CTA Patterns

```
Weak: Submit, Sign Up, Learn More, Click Here
Strong: Start Free Trial, Get [Specific Thing], See [Product] in Action
```

**CTA formula:** `[Action Verb] + [What They Get] + [Qualifier]`

---

## Quick Reference: Copywriting

### Headline Formulas

1. **Outcome + Pain:** `{Achieve outcome} without {pain point}`
2. **Opposite Process:** `The {opposite} way to {outcome}`
3. **Never Again:** `Never {unpleasant event} again`
4. **Feature + Audience:** `{Feature} for {audience} to {use case}`
5. **No Skills Needed:** `You don't have to {skill} to {outcome}`
6. **How It Works:** `{Outcome} by {how product makes it possible}`
7. **Pain Question:** `{Question highlighting main pain point}?`
8. **Transformation:** `Turn {input} into {outcome}`

### Copywriting Principles

- **Clarity over cleverness** — If you must choose, choose clear
- **Benefits over features** — What it means for the customer
- **Specificity over vagueness** — "4 hours to 15 minutes" not "save time"
- **Customer language** — Use words they use, not jargon
- **One idea per section** — Don't say everything everywhere

## Quick Reference: SEO Audit

### Priority Order

1. **Crawlability & Indexation** — Can Google find and index it?
2. **Technical Foundations** — Fast, functional, mobile-friendly?
3. **On-Page Optimization** — Titles, metas, headings optimized?
4. **Content Quality** — Does it deserve to rank?
5. **Authority & Links** — Does it have credibility?

### Quick Checks

| Element | Check For |
|---------|-----------|
| Title tags | Unique, 50-60 chars, keyword near start |
| Meta descriptions | Unique, 150-160 chars, value proposition |
| H1 | One per page, contains primary keyword |
| Core Web Vitals | LCP < 2.5s, INP < 200ms, CLS < 0.1 |
| Mobile | Responsive, proper tap targets |
| Indexation | `site:domain.com`, Search Console coverage |

---

## Quick Reference: Pricing

### Value-Based Pricing

Price between the next best alternative and perceived value. Cost is a floor, not a basis.

### Tier Structure (Good-Better-Best)

| Tier | Purpose | Target |
|------|---------|--------|
| Good (Entry) | Remove barriers | Small teams, try before buy |
| Better (Recommended) | Where most land | Growing teams, serious users |
| Best (Premium) | Capture high value | Larger teams, power users |

### Value Metrics

| Metric | Best For | Examples |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Per user/seat | Collaboration tools | Slack, Notion |
| Per usage | Variable consumption | AWS, Twilio |
| Per feature | Modular products | HubSpot add-ons |
| Per record | CRM, email tools | Mailchimp |
| Flat fee | Simple products | Basecamp |

### Freemium vs Free Trial

**Freemium when:** Viral/network effects, free users provide value, low marginal cost
**Free trial when:** Product needs time to show value, B2B buying committees, higher prices

## Quick Reference: Psychology

### Key Mental Models

| Challenge | Models to Apply |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Low conversions | Hick's Law, Activation Energy, BJ Fogg Model |
| Price objections | Anchoring, Framing, Loss Aversion |
| Building trust | Authority, Social Proof, Reciprocity |
| Increasing urgency | Scarcity, Loss Aversion, Zeigarnik Effect |
| Retention/churn | Endowment Effect, Switching Costs, Status-Quo Bias |
| Decision paralysis | Paradox of Choice, Default Effect, Nudges |

### Persuasion Principles

1. **Reciprocity** — Give first, people want to give back
2. **Commitment & Consistency** — Small commitments lead to larger ones
3. **Social Proof** — People follow what others do
4. **Authority** — People defer to experts
5. **Scarcity** — Limited availability increases value
6. **Liking** — People say yes to those they like

## Page Structure Template

### Landing Page Sections

1. **Hero** — Headline, subheadline, primary CTA, supporting visual
2. **Social proof bar** — Logos or stats
3. **Problem/pain section** — Articulate their frustration
4. **How it works** — 3-4 simple steps
5. **Key benefits** — 2-3, not 10
6. **Testimonial** — Specific results, attribution
7. **Use cases/personas** — Help visitors self-identify
8. **Comparison** — vs. alternatives or status quo
9. **Case study snippet** — Real customer story
10. **FAQ** — Address objections
11. **Final CTA** — Recap value, repeat CTA, risk reversal

### Avoid This Pattern

```
❌ Hero → Feature 1 → Feature 2 → Feature 3 → Feature 4 → CTA
```

Use variety: stories, social proof, comparisons, use cases, FAQs.
