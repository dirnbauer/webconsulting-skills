3. CTA placement and copy
4. Visual hierarchy
5. Trust signals
6. Objection handling
7. Friction removal

- `The {opposite} way to {outcome}`
- `Never {bad thing} again`
- `{Feature} for {audience} to {use case}`

Strong: Start Free Trial, Get [Thing], See [Product] in Action
```

## Copywriting Principles
